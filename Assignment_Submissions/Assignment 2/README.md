
I have explained this assignment in the document. The tests folder has three tests I used for my ouput. 

I used gcd, add-overflow.bril, and loop-orig.bril. I set up my turnt file so that it would run the two new configurations which is reaching definitions and available expressions. 

I had to copy in the cfg, form_blocks, and util files so that the df.py file had all necessary modules and imports. 

To run this, please go inside the test directory and type 

turnt *.bril

and that will run the tests on the test cases.
